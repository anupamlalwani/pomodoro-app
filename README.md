🎯 Focus Timer: A Vibe Coding Project

Welcome to my [Focus Timer app!](https://anupamlalwani.github.io/pomodoro-app/)

This project represents my journey back into creation, built entirely through vibe coding. By leveraging AI tools, I've transformed a vision into a fully functional, installable PWA (Progressive Web App).

🚀 The Journey

This was a completely self-taught and executed project. It was less about writing every line of syntax and more about:

Thinking like a Product Manager: 
Defining the scope and managing the build
Visualizing how a user interacts with the timer.
Listening to feedback and refining the output until the "vibe" was just right.

It’s a humble beginning, but a significant step in my journey toward creating more fun and impactful projects.

✨ Features

Customizable Intervals: Set your own time for both Focus and Break sessions.

Infinite Ambient Audio: Mathematically generated Binaural Beats, Isochronic Tones, and Ocean Waves that never clip or loop.

Immersive Backgrounds: Dynamic abstract art that changes with every session.

Installable PWA: Works on mobile and desktop as a standalone app with offline support.

Privacy First: No login required; all settings are saved locally on your device.

Its not completely bug free, its a work in progress (but workable condition). Feel free to drop any feedback.
